# UCSDUnfoldingMaps
In order to use the following applet, download the source files. Navigate to any one of the module 1-6 directories and run `[EarthquakeCityMap.java]`(https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/UCSDUnfoldingMaps/blob/master/src/module6/EarthquakeCityMap.java) from the command line. Due to modern browsers no longer supporting Java applets, command line is the only way to run the applet. 
Optional: to see the progression from module 1 to 6, run the EarthquakeCityMap.java file from the respective directory. 
## What I Learned
- How to create, manipulate and style GUI's to very specific standards (aka my own nitpicking preferences)
- How to add features such as buttons, markers, etc.
- How to add functionality to GUI's 
- How GUI's render images and background images
- Incorporated Google and Microsoft Map API's to my GUI
- Enhanced my understanding of Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java
- Gained additional practice with algorithmic analysis of Java's built-in Collections sort method and binary searching, as well as practice in how sorting data can provide gains (or not) to different searching algorithms.
- More practice on comparable and abstract interfaces. 
- **Memory modeling**. This is something I never explicitly learned, so it was great to finally connect some underlying dots between how I thought my Java code operated (from previous textbooks and experience) and what I would see on my screen. 
- More practice on Is-A and has-A relationships

## Key Learning Points by Module
### Module 5: Implementing Mouse Click event functionality
- Learned a critical difference between .equals for strings and == operator. In this case, the == operator was necessary as .equals would give incorrect selection of markers when a click occurs.
### Module 6: Sorting, Searching, and Comparable interfaces
- Enhanced my implicit understanding of implementing Comparable interfaces to compare earthquakes specifically in the ordering of this.compareTo(other)
